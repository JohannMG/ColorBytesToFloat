# Byte to UIColor

Tiny tool I built for quick use of giant color pallete.

Your lovely designers finished up their designs and sent you the color pallete in tons of RGB or hexadecimal format. Now you want to turn those into Swift UIColors. Type in quickly the values, and it will return the UIColor() string and paste it automatically to your clipboard (you can turn that off)

Simple terminal tool to do just that! 
 - Byte to float 
 - RGB to UIColor
 - RGBA to UIColor
 - HEX to UIColor 

Grab the entire xcode project if you like or 

Clone to repo OR just grab the terminal app here http://www.johannmg.com/downloads/ColorBytesToFloat
